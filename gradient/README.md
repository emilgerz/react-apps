## Gradient

### Explanation

This is one of the simpliest apps here. It paints background to gradient betwen selected colors in inputs.

### How it works

It works pretty simple: we have two controlled inputs here and button, that applies gradient with two selected colors to the background – background color changes immediately.
On the right side of inputs we have a color-inputs – you can pick color there, so on the left-side input it changes to the selected color. In simple words: theese inputs are linked to each other.
