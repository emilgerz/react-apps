## CIAN Filters

### Explanation

CIAN Filters built to find mortgage for your future house.

### How it works

The application is configured to search for suitable offers from banks. The offers themselves and all information about the bank are stored in a large json file.
The interface is built from controlled reused inputs. Each input has its own state. All states are connected together and checked at the same time using a helper function. This function selects suitable bank offers and displays them in the interface.
